It is probably not a secret that data intelligence has become one of the most exciting fields of this age. Although it may seem the buzzword of our time, it is certainly not the hype. This exciting field opens the way to new possibilities and is becoming indispensable to our daily lives. 

Organizations, big or small, are heavily investing in data intelligence research and applications these days. And hence, it has become the hottest career. If you want to become a data intelligence practitioner, there is no better time than this. 

> The 'Data Intelligence' term in this book represents Data Science(DS), Machine Learning(ML), Artificial Intelligence(AI) fields collectively. These fields are quite closely related but have few differences as well, we will cover those differences in an upcoming chapter.

Aspirants are taking different approaches to get into the field, some are fortunate enough to be put into projects as freshers, but most aspirants are building their capabilities by learning theory and applying them on public data-sets.

> While there is no dearth of free & paid material, too much of information has only confused the current crop of data intelligence aspirants.

Based on the questions that I am asked by them on day to day basis, I can see how perplexed they are. Not to say, taking advantage of the situation, most of the training institutes are minting money like anything, bundling even non-relevant courses as well in data science ones.

# Why this book?

From a time around when data science field started picking up, every other day I get many messages from data intelligence starters & enthusiasts on ‘How can I get into data intelligence field?’. Over a while, I have improvised my response based on the follow-up questions they ask like: 

1. What is the difference between DS, ML, DL, AI, DM? 
2. What are the roles in data intelligence, who does what? 
3. What concepts, processes & tools they need to learn? 
4. Which books, courses, etc they need to refer to?
5. How to build a data intelligence portfolio? 
6. How to write a resume for data intelligence? 
7. How to build a helpful network?
8. How to search for the job? 
9. How to prepare for the interview? 
10. How to stay up to date in this still-evolving field? 

You can notice that these questions are not conceptual ones and there is no dedicated material to address these roadblocks.

How about a book or course that gives you enough exposure to the DS/AI field that you can yourself analyze what is needed for you and build your own roadmap? 

> My answer to the above questions is this book.

# What this book covers?

On an abstract level, it looks fairly simple, overall process can be divided into four logical phases: Navigate, Build, Launch & Maintain.

**Navigate** is the very first phase of your DS/AI journey, where you need to understand the overall landscape before diving deep. This step covers Q1 & Q2.

**Build** phase covers all the concepts, processes, tools you need to learn and the resources you need to refer to gain required knowledge. This step responses Q3 & Q4.

**Launch** is the phase where you build your portfolio, network with like-minded professionals and start looking for job. This step elaborates from Q5 to Q9.

**Maintain** phase details out how you can stay up to date in this ever-evolving field. This step answers Q10.


This book is organized into 8 chapters covering above mentioned framework end-to-end: 

Chapter 1 covers the high-level approach to how you can build your road-map to learn data science & build a career in it.

Chapters 2–7 cover all the steps mentioned in chapter 1 in greater depth to give you enough knowledge to build your road-map.

Chapter 8 guides on how to continue from here, keep yourself updated and remain ahead of the curve in this ever-evolving field.

# Who this book is for?

This series can be useful for a variety of readers, but I wrote it with two main target audiences in mind. One of these target audiences is university students learning about DS/AI field, including those who are starting a career in data science and artificial intelligence. The other target audience is professionals working in other fields, who do not have a data science, statistics or programming background but want to rapidly acquire one and expand their career.

There is no assumption or prerequisites for a reader to cover before reading this series. 

Looks interesting? Stay tuned to read the upcoming post as soon as it is published.

> Please note that this book does not cover data intelligence concepts.

Consider it as a personal coach to launch your career in DS/AI field who gives you enough exposure to the field so that you can yourself prepare a roadmap of your DS/AI journey.
