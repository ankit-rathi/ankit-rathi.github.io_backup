This chapter talks about how you can build your data intelligence portfolio. Lets first understand, why a portfolio is important in data intelligence field?

> Besides the benefit of learning by making a portfolio, a portfolio is important as it can help get you employment.

For the purpose of this article, let’s define a portfolio as public evidence of your data intelligence skills.

People often forget that software engineers and data scientists also google their issues. If these same people have their problems solved by reading your public work, they might think better of you and reach out to you.

> You can gain more data intelligence skills by working on prediction problems rather than getting stuck in endless learning loop.

But you will not get a project to work on from day one of your learning. Still, there are platforms where you can apply and learn data intelligence.

#### UCI ML

<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php>

The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of data-sets that are used by the machine learning community for the analysis of machine learning algorithms. The archive was created as an FTP archive in 1987 by David Aha and fellow graduate students at UC Irvine. Since that time, it has been widely used by students, educators, and researchers all over the world as a primary source of machine learning data-sets. As an indication of the impact of the archive, it has been cited over 1000 times, making it one of the top 100 most cited “papers” in all of computer science. The current version of the web site was designed in 2007 by Arthur Asuncion and David Newman, and this project is in collaboration with Rexa.info at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Funding support from the National Science Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

#### Kaggle Datasets

<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets>

Kaggle is where many data scientists spend their nights and weekends. It’s a crowd-sourced platform to attract, nurture, train and challenge data scientists from all around the world to solve data science, machine learning and predictive analytics problems. It has over half a million active members from 190+ countries and it receives close to 150K submissions per month. Started from Melbourne, Australia Kaggle moved to Silicon Valley in 2011, ultimately been acquired by the Google in March of 2017. Kaggle is the number one stop for data science enthusiasts all around the world who compete for prizes and boost their Kaggle rankings. There are only a handful of Kaggle Grandmasters in the world to this date.

Do you know that most data scientists are only theorists and rarely get a chance to practice before being employed in the real-world? Kaggle solves this problem by giving data science enthusiasts a platform to interact and compete in solving real-life problems. The experience you get on Kaggle is invaluable in preparing you to understand what goes into finding feasible solutions for big data.

### Writing Blog

Writing blogs is an effective way to showcase your expertise and skills. You can write what you have learnt recently, any interesting problem you have solved or worked on any project.

Writing an engaging blog-post is an art in itself, here are few tips to write and promote your blog posts.

#### Take notes for ideas

Start by writing down ideas as they occur to you. Make it a habit and keep doing it consistently by installing a note-taking app (like Keep, EverNote etc) on your mobile device.

Ideas occur to us all the time. You need a way to capture them when they do so that you can turn them into a great blog post in the future.

#### Build a simple outline

It is an essential step to develop an easy-to-follow outline before you sit down to write a blog post.

Once you’ve picked a topic to write about, from the list of ideas that you’ve written down, create an outline. The outline contains a heading, introduction, major points you want to write about and conclusion.

To get the juices flowing, you should actually write the introduction and the conclusion first, then add a list of things that you’ll cover in the body.

#### Start with a story

Entertainment is the biggest factor in engaging your audience. If you’re just about to start a blog, keep this at in your mind.

Stories engage people in and help clear the doubts. You are able to develop a scene which people can relate to.

Become a memorable writer by integrating stories into your blog posts. It doesn’t have to be your own story, you can tell interesting stories about others.

#### Solve common problems

Consistent writing is one of the easiest ways to become a better writer. The question is, what should you write about? As a beginner, write blog posts that answer questions.

Look for the problems that are common in your field, what most of the people are struggling with. Research about that topic, try to explore the problem and its possible solution.

#### Learn & Share

When I write a blog post, I read a lot about the subject. On the web and in real life, there are too many questions with too few answers.

Many a time, you will end up learning yourself in an attempt to write the post on a certain topic.

#### Read other great writers

The truth is that if you don’t read great writers, you don’t really know how to do it and that successful blog that you dream of will evade you.

I’ve learned that I get a better education from studying authors’ best work than I do from waiting for a piece of advice from them.

#### Mentor Others

As part of being a successful and well-rounded data scientist, giving back can be a rewarding and beneficial aspect. Becoming a mentor, or mentoring those who want to follow in your steps of being a data scientist can sharpen your expertise and credentials.

#### Build a Personal Brand

Building a brand is about giving yourself more opportunities to help and connect with people in your industry. And one of the best ways to build a brand is through blogging.

> A blog is a hub for your advice. It also has the added benefit of helping you rank on search engines.

I hope that reading this inspires at least a few of you who want to become a data scientist and want to get better day by day by following the above-mentioned approach.
