### Why This Book?

Enterprises these days are becoming data-rich, but still, they remain insights-poor.

Gartner predicts that 80% of analytics insights will not deliver business outcomes through 2022.

Another study highlights that 87% of data projects never make it to production.

Various studies and researches show that significant effort is spent on data engineering related to discovering, collecting, and preparing data, as well as building and deploying the models in production.

Based on these studies and surveys, there are 6 challenges faced by data professionals in data projects.

- Cultural Challenges
- Data Challenges
- Technology Challenges
- Funding Challenges
- Mismanaged Expectations
- Other Challenges (lack of talent, misconception about the role etc)

So in this book, I want to cover these challenges and would like to propose a framework for businesses to become insights-rich addressing these challenges.

The challenges that you are facing in your data science projects, should fall one of the above categories.
