How to assess the data maturity of your business?

There are two aspects of the assessment.

Let's look at the first aspect:

1. At what stage is your data ecosystem?

Stage A: Manual Processing –> Stage B: Reports & Dashboards –> Stage C: Data Storytelling –> Stage D: Data Intelligence –> Stage E: Data-Driven Organization

The second aspect is:

2. What is the status of your data ecosystem components?

B. How mature is the Data Culture?

C. Have you defined Data Architecture?
