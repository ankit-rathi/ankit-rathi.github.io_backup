| Term | Definition |
| :---: | :---: | 
| [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) | Data are characteristics or information, usually numerical, that are collected through observation. In a more technical sense, data are a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is a single value of a single variable. | 
| [Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) | Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it is that which answers the question of "What an entity is" and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts. | 
| [Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) | Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts (propositional knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge). |
| [Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom) | Wisdom is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense and insight. |
| [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) | Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. |
| [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) | Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. |
| [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) | Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.|
| [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) | Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. |
| [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) | Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, which is unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animal. Leading AI literature defines the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. |
